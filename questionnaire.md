## Three big questions

* **Timing**. What's the start date, end date, and the reason for those dates?
* **Budget**.  What's your budget? Either a specific number or a range. If we were building a house, would we be building a little shack or a giant mansion?
* **Scope**. What's the goal of the project? What's the problem that it's solving? How does the solution meet user needs, meet business needs, and match the core skills of the team (including me!).

## Process

Here's the end-to-end process that I like to follow, to give projects the best chance of success.
Here are the deliverables at each stage.

**TODO: tidy up existing UCD process, make deliverables explicit.**

Follow up:

* What services do you require: User Experience, Design, Development? What stuff do you have already? What's the tech stack?

For design work:

* Please send links to a few sites that you like and a sentence or two about why you like it.
