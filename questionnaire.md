## Four big questions

* **Timing**. What's the start date, end date, and the reason for those dates?
* **Goal**. What's the goal of the project? What's the problem that it's solving? How does the solution meet user needs, meet business needs, and match the core skills of the team (including me!).
* **Scope**. What services do you require: User Experience, Design, Development? What stuff do you have already? Who's on your team for this project?
* **Money**. How much money have you put aside for this? Is it more like R10,000, R100,000, or R1,000,000?

## Process

Here's the end-to-end process that I like to follow, to give projects the best chance of success.
Here are the deliverables at each stage.

**TODO: tidy up existing UCD process diagram, make deliverables explicit.**
